# Multiple Properties

Right now inside the menu bar preview we only show the currently-selected property and a pre-defined icon. We want to allow the user to configure multiple properties to display inside the menu bar at once, and an icon (or label) to associate with each.

They should be able to drag / drop the order of these as well.
